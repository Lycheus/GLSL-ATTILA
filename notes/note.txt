Makefile notes
1. Copy needed file one by one to the folder it need.
2. include <stdio.h> for files that need sprintf
3. modify Makefile where FLAGS using -static -static-libc++ 
   (@ means dont show on console, you can cancel it to see the compilation commands)
   (-lm -lc -lstdc++ not found.)
4. It will need a folder "Gen" under ./src/trace/utils/

5.
ARBP/VertexProgram/VP1Grammar.y:751.26-27: $$ for the midrule at $1 of `vtxOptWeightNum' has no declared type

Implementation/ARBCompilers/VertexProgram/ACDXVP1Grammar.y:751.26-27: $$ for the midrule at $1 of `vtxOptWeightNum' has no declared type

(I changed it from {$$ = 0;} to integer					

6. You have to manually install zlib and then libpng to let -lz -lpng works

7. libpng is kinda tricky using default Makefile, I suggest 
   cp ./script/makefile.gcc Makefile
   Makefile all

   remember to move the libz.a and libpng.a to ATTILA root/lib folder

ATTila tracefile tracing notes
1. glBindProgramARB
   void glBindProgramARB(GLenum target, GLuint program);
   
   target = vertex shader or fragment shader
   program = name of the shader

2. glProgramStringARB
   void glProgramStringARB(GLenum target, GLenum format, GLsizei len, const GLvoid *string);


opengl32.dll can be generate from Microsoft Visual Stuio 2010 on my computer by just build the opengl project
Because of above situation, I have to trace the tracefile from Windows Enviroment and then put the tracefile
back to Linux enviroment and run the simulation.
