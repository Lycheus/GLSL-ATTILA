1. Check if ARB support decision making.
2. Find GLSL compiler to ARBProgram.
3. And think what can it do to verify our GLSL compiler result?

Google Keyword: ProgramARB GLSL OpenGL1.4 OpenGL2.0 DirectX9Programmable Shader Branch Flow Control

Answer:
ARB assembly provides no instructions for flow control or branching.
SGE and SLT may be used to conditionally set or clear vectors or registers.


------------------------

Get a DirectX PIX viewer and see if we can get the HLSL code (string format) out from it.
AMD provide a HLSL to GLSL translator (I think ATTILA has one also)

And there is a GLSL to ARBprogram converter (partial function) provide by nVIDIA named "Cg toolkit"

------------------------

To trace DirectX game code (Starcraft2?)
and show the HLSL code of it and find tool to translate HLSL -> GLSL (AMD toolkit?)
