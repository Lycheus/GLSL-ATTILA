Talked about the purpose of the simulator
1. To do Profiling: 
There are much more things that can be done for the compiler and shader
code, but we need something to convince the hardware team it is worth to do it.
Thus we need to test out theroy first before implement it. So we need Simulator to verify it.

Like the order of the objects, the objects closer to us can be process earlier, thus
the compiler generate some codes that can give hints for the object order.

2. The easier way for it will be making a program translate table to 

3. The short goal will be making a maze and can run on the simulator.
