1. opengl32.dll generate
   opengl32.dll is generate from CLInterceptor.cpp which open 
   GLIconfig.ini for setting and record the GLcalls write to the tracefile.txt
   and then execute it in real calls.

   some program will use opengl32.dll in its folder first (industry standard?)
   but for those who don't you'll need to replace the real opengl32.dll
   in /system folder.

2. how it work
3. GLwrapper
   Most of the code are generate from .gen file which is automatically parse
   from another file (opengl32.def maybe?) and included from standard opengl
   lib (mesaGLUT?)

4. our Architecture vs ATTILA
   This part is way too big for me to solo.
   I need some help and times to figure all of them out.
   mostly because I'm not familier with a GPU architecture
   thus I'll lost orientation when tracing the codes.

5. GLSL(IR form) code extraction
   on Server Desktop, I dig out the ARB program from QUAKE4 tracefile
   1143 lines but I dont think it contains complex motion or
   heavy load process.
